# IndexForge Migration Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the phased migration plan for completing the IndexForge codebase. The plan is structured to ensure minimal disruption while maintaining system stability and functionality throughout the migration process.

## Current Status

- Core vector indexing functionality implemented
- Basic search capabilities operational
- Document processing pipeline established
- Test infrastructure in place
- Initial connectors available

## Migration Phases

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Current)

#### Completed Components

- ✅ Vector index implementation (`src/indexing/index/vector_index.py`)
- ✅ Search functionality (`src/indexing/search/search_executor.py`)
- ✅ Document processing pipeline (`src/pipeline/core.py`)
- ✅ Basic connectors (`src/connectors/`)
- ✅ Storage service implementations (`src/services/storage/`)
  - ✅ Document storage service
  - ✅ Chunk storage service
  - ✅ Reference storage service
  - ✅ Storage metrics service

#### Remaining Tasks

1. Fix import cycles in storage services
2. Finalize exports in `src/indexing/__init__.py`
3. Document API endpoints and usage
4. Add integration tests for core functionality

### Phase 2: Source Tracking

#### Source Management Implementation

1. Schema Management

   - [ ] Source-specific schema variations
   - [ ] Schema validation and enforcement
   - [ ] Configuration persistence
   - [ ] Schema migration utilities

2. Multi-tenancy Support

   - [ ] Tenant isolation implementation
   - [ ] Schema overrides per tenant
   - [ ] Cross-tenant search capabilities
   - [ ] Tenant-specific configuration management

3. Metrics Collection
   - ✅ Core metrics infrastructure
   - ✅ Storage metrics implementation
   - [ ] Source-level metrics tracking
   - [ ] Performance monitoring
   - [ ] Usage statistics
   - [ ] Health checks

### Phase 3: Document Lineage

#### Document History Tracking

1. Processing History

   - [ ] Step-by-step transformation logging
   - [ ] Error tracking and recovery
   - [ ] Version control integration
   - [ ] Rollback capabilities

2. Cross-Reference Management

   - [ ] Reference tracking system
   - [ ] Semantic similarity analysis
   - [ ] Circular reference detection
   - [ ] Bidirectional reference support

3. Metadata Enhancement
   - [ ] Extended metadata schema
   - [ ] Automated metadata extraction
   - [ ] Custom metadata support
   - [ ] Metadata validation rules

### Phase 4: Integration and Testing

#### Testing Infrastructure

1. Integration Tests

   - [ ] Component integration tests
   - [ ] API endpoint tests
   - [ ] Error handling tests
   - [ ] Performance tests

2. End-to-End Testing

   - [ ] Full pipeline tests
   - [ ] Multi-tenant scenarios
   - [ ] Load testing
   - [ ] Recovery testing

3. Documentation
   - [ ] API documentation
   - [ ] Integration guides
   - [ ] Configuration reference
   - [ ] Best practices guide

## Implementation Guidelines

### Code Quality

- Follow existing code style and patterns
- Maintain comprehensive docstrings
- Include type hints
- Add unit tests for new functionality

### Performance Considerations

- Implement caching where appropriate
- Optimize batch operations
- Monitor memory usage
- Consider scalability in design

### Security Requirements

- Implement proper authentication
- Validate inputs
- Handle sensitive data appropriately
- Follow security best practices

## Timeline and Dependencies

### Critical Path

1. Complete core infrastructure
2. Implement source tracking
3. Add document lineage
4. Finalize testing

### Dependencies

- Weaviate vector database
- Redis for caching
- OpenAI API for embeddings
- RabbitMQ for messaging

## Monitoring and Validation

### Success Metrics

- Test coverage > 80%
- Performance benchmarks met
- All critical functionality tested
- Documentation complete

### Quality Gates

- Code review approval
- Test suite passing
- Performance requirements met
- Security review passed

## Rollback Plan

### Rollback Triggers

- Critical bugs discovered
- Performance degradation
- Data integrity issues
- Security vulnerabilities

### Rollback Steps

1. Revert to last known good state
2. Restore data if necessary
3. Run validation tests
4. Update documentation

## Next Steps

1. Review and prioritize Phase 2 tasks
2. Assign resources to critical path items
3. Set up monitoring for success metrics
4. Begin implementation of source tracking

## Updates and Reviews

This document should be reviewed and updated regularly as the migration progresses. All major changes and decisions should be documented here.
