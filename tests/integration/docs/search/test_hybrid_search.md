# Hybrid Search Test Documentation

## Purpose

Validates hybrid search capabilities (BM25 + vector similarity) when integrating Core Schema System with Document Processing Schema.

## Test Cases and Expected Outcomes

### 1. Exact Keyword Match

- **Description**: Tests that exact keyword matches are found with high BM25 scores
- **Test Cases**:
  - Query: "neural networks"
  - Documents with exact phrase
  - Documents with similar content
- **Expected Outcome**:
  - High ranking for exact matches
  - Found in top 2 results
- **Implementation Notes**:
  - BM25 scoring
  - Result ranking
  - Match verification

### 2. Semantic Similarity Match

- **Description**: Tests that semantically similar content is found with high vector similarity
- **Test Cases**:
  - Query: "AI and ML technologies"
  - Documents about machine learning
  - Documents about artificial intelligence
- **Expected Outcome**:
  - High ranking for semantic matches
  - Found in top 2 results
- **Implementation Notes**:
  - Vector similarity
  - Semantic matching
  - Result verification

### 3. Hybrid Search Weighting

- **Description**: Tests that hybrid search weights affect result ranking appropriately
- **Test Cases**:
  - BM25-heavy (α = 0.9)
  - Vector-heavy (α = 0.1)
  - Balanced (α = 0.5)
- **Expected Outcome**:
  - Different rankings per weight
  - Results reflect weighting
- **Implementation Notes**:
  - Weight configuration
  - Ranking comparison
  - Result validation

### 4. Out-of-Vocabulary Handling

- **Description**: Tests handling of queries with out-of-vocabulary terms
- **Test Cases**:
  - Query with unknown term
  - Query with mixed terms
- **Expected Outcome**:
  - Relevant results found
  - Known terms prioritized
- **Implementation Notes**:
  - Term handling
  - Result relevance
  - Match verification

### 5. Multi-Language Search

- **Description**: Tests search functionality across multiple languages
- **Test Cases**:
  - Cross-language queries
  - Mixed language content
  - Language detection
- **Expected Outcome**:
  - Accurate language detection
  - Relevant results across languages
  - Proper ranking
- **Implementation Notes**:
  - Language detection
  - Translation handling
  - Relevance scoring

### 6. Search Performance Under Load

- **Description**: Tests search performance with high query volume
- **Test Cases**:
  - Concurrent searches
  - Large result sets
  - Complex queries
- **Expected Outcome**:
  - Sub-second response
  - Consistent performance
  - Resource efficiency
- **Implementation Notes**:
  - Load testing
  - Performance monitoring
  - Resource tracking

## Risk Assessment

- **Criticality**: HIGH
- **Impact of Failure**:
  - Search inaccuracy
  - Missed matches
  - Ranking errors
  - Performance issues
  - User experience

## Coverage Gaps

- Multi-language queries
- Long document handling
- Query preprocessing
- Score normalization
- Edge case handling

## Test Dependencies

- Requires SchemaValidator
- Uses text_processing utils
- Needs base_schema fixture
- Depends on numpy
