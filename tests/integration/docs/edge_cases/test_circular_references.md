# Circular References Test Documentation

## Purpose

Validates the system's ability to detect and prevent circular references in document relationships, ensuring data integrity and preventing infinite loops during traversal.

## Test Cases and Expected Outcomes

### 1. Direct Self-Reference Test

- **Description**: Tests a document attempting to reference itself as its parent
- **Expected Outcome**:
  - ValidationError raised with message matching "circular.\*reference"
  - Document not saved to database
- **Prevention**: Stops creation of documents that could cause infinite loops
- **Implementation Notes**:
  ```python
  doc = {
      "id": "doc1",
      "parent_id": "doc1"  # Self-reference
  }
  # Should raise ValidationError
  ```
- **Expected Failures**:
  - When parent_id equals document's own ID
  - When chunk_ids contains document's own ID

### 2. Indirect Circular Reference Test

- **Description**: Tests chain of documents forming a circular reference (A→B→A)
- **Expected Outcome**:
  - ValidationError raised with message matching "circular.\*reference"
  - Transaction rolled back
- **Real-World Example**:
  ```
  Document A (parent: none)
  └── Document B (parent: A)
      └── Document C (parent: B)
          └── Attempt to set A as child (SHOULD FAIL)
  ```

### 3. Complex Circular Chain Test

- **Description**: Tests multi-level circular references (A→B→C→A)
- **Expected Outcome**:
  - ValidationError with chain details
  - All documents in chain identified
- **Implementation Notes**:
  - Must traverse full document hierarchy
  - Cache visited documents for performance

### 4. Mixed Parent-Child Test

- **Description**: Tests circular references through mixed parent-child relationships
- **Expected Outcome**:
  - Detects circles regardless of relationship type
  - Provides clear error message identifying relationship path

### 5. Valid Complex Relationships Test

- **Description**: Tests valid complex hierarchies that might appear circular
- **Expected Outcome**:
  - Allows valid hierarchical structures
  - No false positives for legitimate relationships

## Risk Assessment

- **Criticality**: HIGH
- **Impact of Failure**:
  - Data corruption
  - Infinite loops in traversal operations
  - System hangs during recursive operations

## Coverage Gaps

- Concurrent modification scenarios
- Cross-database references
- Very deep hierarchies (>1000 levels)

## Test Dependencies

- Requires `base_schema` fixture
- Needs clean database state
- Depends on transaction support
