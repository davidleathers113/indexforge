## Refactoring Approach

For each file:

1. Analyze current test groupings and responsibilities
2. Identify logical separation points
3. Create new test files with focused purposes
4. Move related tests to appropriate new files
5. Update imports and fixtures
6. Verify test coverage is maintained
7. Run full test suite to ensure no regressions

### Example Refactoring Plan

Using `tests/fixtures/system/pipeline.py` (296 lines) as an example:

1. Create new files:

   - `tests/fixtures/system/pipeline/config_fixtures.py`
   - `tests/fixtures/system/pipeline/state_fixtures.py`
   - `tests/fixtures/system/pipeline/mock_data_fixtures.py`

2. Move fixtures to appropriate files:

   - Configuration-related fixtures -> `config_fixtures.py`
   - Pipeline state management -> `state_fixtures.py`
   - Test data and mocks -> `mock_data_fixtures.py`

3. Update imports in affected test files
4. Verify fixture availability and test execution
5. Run coverage analysis to ensure no gaps
6. Document new fixture organization

## Project Constraints

- All changes must maintain compatibility with existing CI/CD pipelines
- Refactoring should not impact test coverage metrics
- Changes should align with current dependency management practices
- Consider impact on parallel test execution

## Background

You are reviewing Python test files that exceed 100 lines to ensure they follow testing best practices and to identify opportunities for improved organization. Each change should be purposeful and contribute to the overall goals of maintainability, clarity, and reliability.

## Core Testing Standards

### Important Note

Before beginning any test refactoring, ensure you have a comprehensive understanding of the test suite's current behavior and coverage. All changes must preserve existing functionality while improving maintainability.

### 1. Test File Organization and Structure

- Maximum recommended file length: 100 lines
- Maximum recommended individual test length: 20 lines
- Each test file should focus on a single feature, component, or responsibility
- File names must clearly indicate what is being tested (e.g., `test_user_authentication.py` not `test_auth.py`)
- Tests within a file should be logically grouped and ordered
- Use clear section comments to separate different test categories
- Avoid mixing unrelated functionality tests in the same file

### 2. Test Structure Requirements

- Each test should verify exactly one behavior or scenario
- Tests must be independent and able to run in any order
- Tests should have clear setup, action, and verification phases
- Avoid test interdependencies
- Use clear, descriptive assertion messages
- Prefer clarity over terseness in assertions
- Consider using parameterized tests for similar test cases using `@pytest.mark.parametrize`
- Document complex test scenarios with clear docstrings

Example of good test structure:

```python
def test_user_registration_with_valid_data():
    """Verify user registration succeeds with valid input data."""
    # Setup
    user_data = create_valid_user_data()

    # Action
    result = register_user(user_data)

    # Verification
    assert result.success is True, "Registration should succeed with valid data"
    assert result.user.email == user_data["email"], "User email should match input"
```

### 3. Code Reuse and Modularity

- Common setup code belongs in fixtures
- Shared test utilities should be in helper modules
- Fixtures should be in `conftest.py` when used across multiple test files
- Complex test data should be stored in separate data files
- Optimize fixture scope (session, module, function) for performance
- Use parameterization (`pytest.mark.parametrize`) to reduce code duplication
- Ensure fixtures are properly scoped and cleaned up

### 4. Test Dependencies and Integration

- Identify and document test interdependencies
- Avoid hidden coupling between test files
- Preserve end-to-end test coverage when splitting files
- Maintain comprehensive edge case coverage
- Consider CI/CD pipeline efficiency in file organization

### 5. Performance and Maintenance

- Group related tests for optimal parallel execution
- Use appropriate pytest markers for test categorization
- Monitor and optimize test execution time
- Document test organization and patterns in README
- Regular audit of test duplication and coverage

## Required Analysis Per File

Before beginning analysis, ensure you have access to:

- Test coverage reports
- CI/CD pipeline configuration
- Project dependency documentation
- Existing test fixtures and helpers

For each test file that exceeds 100 lines:

1. File Overview

   - Current line count and primary testing focus
   - List of distinct functionalities being tested
   - Identification of any mixed responsibilities

2. Refactoring Opportunities

   - Specify which sections should be split into new files
   - Identify common setup code that should move to fixtures
   - Point out redundant or duplicated test code
   - Suggest helper functions to reduce repetition

3. Proposed New Structure

   - Names and purposes of suggested new test files
   - Location and scope of new fixture files
   - Updated file organization to improve test isolation

4. Implementation Plan
   - Step-by-step refactoring instructions
   - Line number ranges for code that should move
   - Required changes to imports and dependencies
   - Testing approach to ensure refactoring preserves behavior

## Output Format

The output should be comprehensive yet actionable. For each file reviewed, provide:

### Detailed Report Template

```markdown

- Parallel execution opportunities
- Suggested pytest markers
- Dependencies on external systems
- Mocking/stubbing recommendations

#### Documentation Updates

- README changes required
- Update to testing guidelines
- New patterns introduced
- Migration notes for developers

#### Expected Outcome

- Improved organization benefits
```

## Additional Guidelines

1. Test Suite Health Checks

- Run coverage analysis before and after changes
- Check for duplicate test scenarios
- Verify edge case coverage
- Assess fixture scope optimization
- Review parameterization opportunities
- Analyze test execution time

2. Ensure refactoring preserves:

   - Test coverage
   - Test readability
   - Easy maintenance
   - Clear test purposes

3. Consider splitting files when you find:

   - Multiple distinct features being tested
   - Different testing strategies mixed together
   - Separate domains or components
   - Independent test scenarios

4. Evaluate fixtures for:
   - Reusability across tests
   - Setup complexity
   - Data management
   - Mock configurations

## Final Deliverable

Produce a complete audit report covering all files listed in the input JSON, with each file analyzed according to the format above. Include a summary of common patterns found and overall recommendations for improving the test suite structure.
