# Metrics and Performance Monitoring

## Overview

The metrics and performance monitoring system provides comprehensive insights into service behavior, resource utilization, and operational health. This documentation covers the core components, usage patterns, and best practices.

For visual representations of the system, see:

- [System Architecture Diagrams](diagrams/architecture.md)
- [Component Interactions](diagrams/component_interactions.md)
- [Error Handling and Recovery](diagrams/error_handling.md)

## Components

### ServiceMetricsCollector

The central component for metrics collection and analysis. It provides:

- Operation timing and tracking
- Memory usage monitoring
- Error rate calculation
- Health check capabilities
- Performance profiling

See the [Metrics Flow diagram](diagrams/component_interactions.md#metrics-flow) for detailed interaction patterns.

```python
metrics = ServiceMetricsCollector(
    service_name="my_service",
    max_history=1000,
    memory_threshold_mb=500
)
```

#### Key Parameters

- `service_name`: Identifier for the service being monitored
- `max_history`: Maximum number of operations to keep in history (default: 1000)
- `memory_threshold_mb`: Memory usage threshold in MB (default: 500)

### Operation Tracking

Track individual operations using the context manager:

```python
with metrics.measure_operation("operation_name", metadata={"key": "value"}):
    # Your operation code here
    perform_task()
```

The context manager automatically records:

- Start and end times
- Duration
- Memory usage
- Success/failure status
- Error information (if applicable)

### Metrics Analysis

#### Current Metrics

Get current service metrics:

```python
metrics = service.get_metrics()
```

Returns:

- Total operations count
- Error rate
- Average duration
- Memory usage statistics
- Operation counts
- Error counts
- Slow operations list

#### Operation-Specific Metrics

Analyze specific operations:

```python
metrics = service.get_operation_metrics(
    "operation_name",
    time_window=timedelta(minutes=5)
)
```

Returns:

- Total calls
- Success rate
- Average duration
- Memory usage
- Error rate

### Health Monitoring

Monitor service health:

```python
health = service.get_health()
```

Checks:

- Memory usage vs threshold
- Error rate (warning if > 5%)
- Slow operations presence
- Overall service status

## Performance Testing

### Test Categories

1. **Validation Performance**

   - Language validation with caching
   - Batch validation with different sizes
   - Memory usage monitoring

2. **Service Operations**
   - Redis pipeline performance
   - Weaviate batch operations
   - Scaling behavior analysis

### Running Performance Tests

```bash
pytest tests/performance/test_performance.py -v
```

### Key Metrics

- Operation duration
- Memory usage
- Resource utilization
- Batch processing efficiency
- Cache hit rates

## Best Practices

### Metrics Collection

1. **Operation Naming**

   - Use consistent, descriptive names
   - Include relevant context
   - Follow naming conventions

2. **Metadata Usage**

   - Include relevant operation parameters
   - Add context for debugging
   - Don't over-collect

3. **Memory Management**
   - Monitor memory thresholds
   - Clean up resources properly
   - Use batch processing for large operations

### Performance Testing

1. **Test Data**

   - Use realistic data sizes
   - Test edge cases
   - Include various batch sizes

2. **Resource Monitoring**

   - Track memory usage
   - Monitor CPU utilization
   - Check I/O operations

3. **Benchmarking**
   - Establish baselines
   - Track performance trends
   - Alert on regressions

## Service Integration

### Redis Service

The Redis service includes metrics for:

- Pipeline operations
- Cache hit/miss rates
- Connection health
- Memory usage

See the [Service Layer Interactions diagram](diagrams/component_interactions.md#service-layer-interactions) for integration details.

### Weaviate Service

The Weaviate service tracks:

- Batch operation performance
- Vector search timing
- Memory usage
- Connection health

See the [Batch Processing diagram](diagrams/component_interactions.md#batch-processing) for detailed flow.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **High Memory Usage**

   - Check batch sizes
   - Verify cleanup operations
   - Monitor resource leaks
     See the [Resource Error Recovery diagram](diagrams/error_handling.md#resource-error-recovery) for handling steps.

2. **Slow Operations**

   - Review operation patterns
   - Check resource availability
   - Optimize batch sizes
     See the [Circuit Breaker Pattern](diagrams/error_handling.md#circuit-breaker-pattern) for handling degraded performance.

3. **High Error Rates**
   - Check service health
   - Verify configurations
   - Review error patterns
     See the [Error Detection and Classification diagram](diagrams/error_handling.md#error-detection-and-classification) for analysis.

### Performance Optimization

1. **Caching Strategy**

   - Use appropriate cache sizes
   - Monitor hit rates
   - Clean up unused entries
     See the [Service Recovery Flow](diagrams/error_handling.md#service-recovery-flow) for handling cache issues.

2. **Batch Processing**

   - Optimize batch sizes
   - Monitor memory usage
   - Balance throughput and latency
     See the [Batch Error Recovery diagram](diagrams/error_handling.md#batch-error-recovery) for handling failures.

3. **Resource Management**
   - Implement proper cleanup
   - Monitor resource usage
   - Use connection pooling
     See the [Resource Error Recovery diagram](diagrams/error_handling.md#resource-error-recovery) for handling resource issues.

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Key Metrics to Monitor

1. **Service Health**

   - Overall status
   - Error rates
   - Resource usage
     See the [Error Reporting Flow](diagrams/error_handling.md#error-reporting-flow) for monitoring details.

2. **Performance**

   - Operation duration
   - Slow operations
   - Memory usage
     See the [Error Handling Strategy](diagrams/error_handling.md#error-handling-strategy) for performance issues.

3. **Resource Utilization**
   - Memory trends
   - Operation patterns
   - Error patterns
     See the [Resource Error Recovery](diagrams/error_handling.md#resource-error-recovery) for utilization issues.

See the [Health Monitoring Flow diagram](diagrams/component_interactions.md#health-monitoring-flow) for the complete monitoring process.

### Alert Thresholds

1. **Critical Alerts**

   - Error rate > 5%
   - Memory usage > threshold
   - Service unhealthy

2. **Warning Alerts**
   - Slow operations detected
   - High resource usage
   - Performance degradation
