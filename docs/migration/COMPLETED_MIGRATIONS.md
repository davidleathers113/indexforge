## Tracking System Implementation

### Core Models and Protocols

- Implemented protocol-based design for tracking components
- Added runtime checkable protocols for `Transformation`, `ProcessingStep`, and `LogEntry`
- Created `DocumentLineage` class for comprehensive document history tracking
- Added serialization support for all tracking components

### Tracking Model Implementations

- Created concrete implementations in `src/core/tracking/models/tracking.py`
- Implemented enum-based types for categorization
- Added timestamp handling and validation
- Implemented dictionary serialization/deserialization

### Testing Infrastructure

- Created comprehensive test suite for tracking models
- Added protocol compliance tests
- Implemented serialization/deserialization tests
- Added integration tests with DocumentLineage
- Included edge case handling and validation

### Documentation

- Added detailed architecture documentation in `docs/architecture/tracking.md`
- Documented design decisions and rationale
- Added usage guidelines and best practices
- Included code examples for common operations

### Files Completed
