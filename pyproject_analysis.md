### Recommended Updates

```toml
[tool.poetry.dependencies]
pydantic = "^2.10.5"
weaviate-client = "^4.10.2"
httpx = "^0.28.1"
transformers = "^4.48.0"
torch = "^2.5.1"
spacy = "^3.8.3"

[tool.poetry.group.dev.dependencies]
ruff = "^0.9.1"
```

## Current Implementation

### 1. Dependency Organization

- **Core Dependencies**: Well-structured with clear version constraints

  ```toml
  [tool.poetry.dependencies]
  python = ">=3.11,<3.13"
  fastapi = "^0.115.6"
  uvicorn = {version = "^0.34.0", extras = ["standard"]}
  ```

- **Optional Groups**: Excellent modular organization
  ```toml
  [tool.poetry.group.storage]
  [tool.poetry.group.monitoring]
  [tool.poetry.group.ml]
  [tool.poetry.group.parsing]
  [tool.poetry.group.docs]
  [tool.poetry.group.ci]
  [tool.poetry.group.dev]
  ```

### 2. Version Management

#### Strengths

- Appropriate use of caret (`^`) version constraints
- Critical dependencies properly pinned
- Python version constraint well-defined

#### Areas for Review

- Some version ranges could be more specific
- Consider pinning versions for critical ML components

### 3. Security and Performance

#### Implemented Features

- Security extras enabled for key packages
- Performance optimizations in place
- Proper use of extras for enhanced functionality

#### Potential Enhancements

- Consider adding security extras for more HTTP clients
- Evaluate performance extras for serialization

### 4. Development Tools

#### Current Setup

- Comprehensive linting configuration
- Strong type checking with mypy
- Pre-commit hooks configured

#### Testing Infrastructure

- Well-organized test structure
- Multiple test runners and plugins
- Good coverage configuration

## Recommendations

### 1. Dependency Management

```toml
[tool.poetry.dependencies]
# Consider adding security extras
httpx = {version = "0.27.0", extras = ["security", "http2"]}
pydantic = {version = "^2.10.4", extras = ["email", "orjson"]}
```

### 2. Development Configuration

```toml
[tool.poetry.scripts]
test = "pytest"
lint = "pre-commit run --all-files"
typecheck = "mypy"
```

### 3. Build and Package Management

- Maintain current Poetry core configuration
- Keep multiple package sources as implemented

## Best Practices Alignment

### 1. Poetry Standards

✅ Follows recommended structure
✅ Uses group feature appropriately
✅ Implements build system correctly

### 2. Security Best Practices

✅ Security extras enabled where critical
✅ Proper version constraints
⚠️ Consider additional security extras

### 3. Performance Optimization

✅ Uses performance-oriented extras
✅ Appropriate caching configurations
⚠️ Consider additional serialization optimizations

## Conclusion

The project demonstrates strong dependency management practices with Poetry. The recommendations focus on enhancing security and performance while maintaining the existing well-structured configuration.

## Next Steps

1. Review and implement suggested security extras
2. Evaluate performance optimization opportunities
3. Consider adding convenience scripts
4. Maintain current best practices in dependency management
