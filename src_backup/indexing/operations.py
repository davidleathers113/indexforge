"""Handles various operations for the vector index.

This module provides operation handlers for the vector index, managing document
operations, schema validation, and batch processing. It serves as a central
point for executing database operations.

Features:
1. Operation Management:
   - Document operations
   - Batch processing
   - Schema validation
   - Error handling

2. Schema Integration:
   - Schema validation
   - Type checking
   - Relationship validation
   - Consistency enforcement

3. Resource Management:
   - Connection handling
   - Batch size control
   - Resource cleanup
   - Error recovery

Usage:
    ```python
    import weaviate
    from src.indexing.schema.schema_validator import SchemaValidator
    from src.indexing.operations import Operations

    # Initialize components
    client = weaviate.Client("http://localhost:8080")
    validator = SchemaValidator(client, "Document")

    # Create operations handler
    operations = Operations(
        client=client,
        class_name="Document",
        batch_size=100,
        schema_validator=validator
    )
    ```

Note:
    - Handles all database operations
    - Validates data consistency
    - Manages batch processing
    - Provides error handling
