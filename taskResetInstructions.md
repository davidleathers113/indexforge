# Development Context Summary

## Task Overview & Current Status

### Core Problem/Feature

- Implementing a document processing system with support for multiple file types (Excel, Word)
- Focus on performance, resource management, and scalability
- Part of larger ML pipeline migration and restructuring effort

### Current Status

- Base processor framework completed ✅
- Excel and Word processors implemented ✅
- Integration tests completed ✅
- Performance benchmarks implemented ✅
- Currently in Phase 3 of migration (ML Component Migration)

### Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Processor Hierarchy**

   - Base processor class with common functionality
   - Specialized processors for each document type
   - Rationale: Promotes code reuse and consistent interface

2. **Configuration Management**

   - Pydantic-based configuration system
   - Separate configs for each processor type
   - Rationale: Type safety and validation at configuration level

3. **Resource Management**
   - Context manager pattern for resource cleanup
   - Explicit initialization/cleanup lifecycle
   - Rationale: Predictable resource handling and memory management

### Critical Constraints

- Memory usage limits: < 500MB per processor instance
- Processing time: < 30s for standard documents
- Thread safety for concurrent processing
- Proper resource cleanup required

   - Streaming large files when possible
   - Explicit cleanup of resources
   - Memory usage monitoring and limits

2. Scalability
   - Thread-safe processor implementations
   - Configurable batch sizes
   - Resource pooling for concurrent processing

### Security Considerations

- File size limits enforced
- File type validation
- Content validation before processing
- Memory limits to prevent DOS

## Development Progress

2. Import path issues in some modules
3. Memory spikes during large file processing

### Failed Approaches

1. Using memory mapping for large files

   - Issue: Inconsistent performance across platforms
   - Solution: Switched to chunked reading

2. Generic processor configuration
   - Issue: Lost type safety
   - Solution: Specialized configs for each processor type

## Developer Notes

### Codebase Insights

- Processor initialization is lazy - resources allocated on first use
- Configuration validation happens at instantiation time
- Error handling follows hierarchy pattern
- Memory cleanup is automatic via context managers

### Temporary Solutions

- Manual garbage collection calls in large file tests
- Fixed timeouts in performance tests
- Hardcoded limits for concurrent processing

### Areas Needing Attention

1. Resource pooling for concurrent processing
2. Error recovery mechanisms
3. Performance optimization for memory usage
4. Service layer integration points
5. Documentation of performance characteristics

### Best Practices

1. Always use context managers for processors
2. Validate configurations before processing
3. Monitor memory usage in concurrent scenarios
4. Follow error handling patterns
5. Add performance tests for new features
