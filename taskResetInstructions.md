# IndexForge Migration - Development Context Summary

## Task Overview & Current Status

### Core Problem

- Migrating source tracking functionality from connector-specific implementation to core package
- Restructuring document operations and lineage tracking for better maintainability
- Consolidating monitoring and management capabilities

### Implementation Status

- Core infrastructure complete âœ…
- Chunking system complete âœ…
- Document tracking system complete âœ…
- Document processor migration complete âœ…
- Source tracking migration in progress ðŸ”„

### Key Architectural Decisions

1. Centralization of core functionality

   - Moving document operations to core package for reusability
   - Standardizing storage interfaces for consistency
   - Implementing unified validation strategies

2. Enhanced Type Safety

   - Strict type checking throughout codebase
   - Comprehensive validation at boundaries
   - Type-safe storage implementation

3. Monitoring Infrastructure
   - Centralized metrics collection
   - Performance monitoring integration
   - Structured logging system

### Critical Constraints

- Must maintain backward compatibility
- Zero downtime migration requirement
- Strict type safety enforcement
- Performance impact < 2% degradation

## Codebase Navigation

### Key Files (By Priority)

1. Core Operations

   - `src/core/tracking/operations.py`
     - Core document management functionality
     - Recently migrated from connector
     - Handles document CRUD operations

2. Lineage Tracking

   - `src/core/tracking/lineage/operations.py`
     - Document relationship management
     - Parent-child tracking
     - Derivation chain handling

3. Storage Implementation

   - `src/core/tracking/storage.py`
     - Document persistence layer
     - Metrics integration
     - Batch operation support

4. Monitoring (Pending Migration)
   - `src/connectors/direct_documentation_indexing/source_tracking/alert_manager.py`
   - `src/connectors/direct_documentation_indexing/source_tracking/error_logging.py`
   - `src/connectors/direct_documentation_indexing/source_tracking/health_check.py`
   - Moving to `src/core/monitoring/`

### Dependencies

- Core models package
- Schema validation system
- Storage metrics infrastructure
- Type-safe storage implementation

## Technical Context

### Technical Assumptions

1. Document relationships are acyclic
2. Storage operations are atomic
3. Metrics collection has negligible performance impact
4. Document IDs are globally unique

### External Services

- Redis for caching
- Storage backend (configurable)
- Metrics collection service

### Performance Considerations

- Batch operations for bulk processing
- Caching with size limits and TTL
- Memory management with usage tracking
- Optimized validation strategies

### Security Requirements

- Secure metadata persistence
- Encryption for sensitive data
- Access control implementation
- Audit logging

## Development Progress

### Last Completed Tasks

- Core document operations migration
- Storage interface integration
- Test suite refactoring
- API documentation for core metrics

### Immediate Next Steps

1. File Migrations:

   - Move monitoring components to core
   - Migrate storage management
   - Transfer utility modules

2. Documentation:
   - Complete API documentation
   - Update configuration guides
   - Merge reference documentation

### Known Issues

1. Cross-package functionality verification pending
2. API integration tests incomplete
3. Documentation references need updating
4. Empty directories cleanup required

### Failed Approaches

- Direct storage migration (caused consistency issues)
- Parallel validation strategies (performance impact)
- In-place file updates (breaking changes)

## Developer Notes

### Codebase Insights

1. Storage layer has implicit dependencies on validation
2. Metrics collection affects all operations
3. Document relationships require bidirectional updates
4. Configuration changes need careful validation

### Temporary Solutions

1. Cross-package imports during migration
2. Duplicate validation logic in transition
3. Manual relationship verification

### Critical Areas

1. Document Relationship Management

   - Careful handling of parent-child updates
   - Validation of relationship chains
   - Circular reference prevention

2. Storage Operations

   - Transaction handling
   - Error recovery
   - Consistency maintenance

3. Configuration Management
   - Environment-specific settings
   - Secure field handling
   - Migration compatibility

### Migration Recommendations

1. Use staged migration approach
2. Maintain comprehensive test coverage
3. Document all configuration changes
4. Verify backward compatibility
5. Monitor performance metrics
