# IndexForge Development Context Summary

## Task Overview & Current Status

### Core Problem/Feature

- Migrating document operations and lineage tracking from connector-specific implementation to core functionality
- Moving from `src/connectors/direct_documentation_indexing/source_tracking/` to `src/core/tracking/`
- Implementing comprehensive test coverage and validation strategies

### Current Status

- Document operations migration complete âœ…

  - Core functionality migrated
  - Storage interface integrated
  - Validation strategies implemented
  - Test suite migrated and passing
  - Integration tests complete
  - API documentation pending

- Document lineage migration in progress ðŸ”„
  - Core functionality migrated
  - Operations module migrated
  - Manager implementation migrated
  - Test suite migrated and passing
  - Integration tests complete
  - API documentation pending

### Key Architectural Decisions

1. Separation of Concerns:

   - Core operations in `src/core/tracking/operations.py`
   - Lineage-specific operations in `src/core/tracking/lineage/operations.py`
   - Validation strategies in dedicated module

2. Storage Interface:

   - Using `LineageStorage` protocol for storage abstraction
   - Mock implementation for testing
   - Clear separation between storage and business logic

3. Validation Strategy:
   - Dedicated validation module for circular references
   - Comprehensive relationship validation
   - Strict type checking and error handling

### Critical Constraints

- Must maintain backward compatibility
- Zero tolerance for circular references in document lineage
- Strict type safety requirements
- Comprehensive test coverage required

## Codebase Navigation

### Key Files (Ranked by Importance)

1. `src/core/tracking/operations.py`

   - Core document operations implementation
   - Handles document creation and relationship management
   - Recently migrated and fully tested

2. `src/core/tracking/lineage/operations.py`

   - Document lineage operations
   - Manages derivation chains and relationships
   - Successfully migrated with tests

3. `src/core/tracking/validation/strategies/circular.py`

   - Circular reference validation
   - Critical for maintaining data integrity
   - Recently updated with improved error messages

4. `tests/core/tracking/test_operations.py`

   - Core operations test suite
   - Comprehensive coverage of document operations
   - All tests passing

5. `tests/core/tracking/lineage/test_operations.py`

   - Lineage operations test suite
   - Covers derivation and relationship validation
   - All tests passing

6. `src/core/interfaces/storage.py`
   - Storage interface definitions
   - Used by both operations and lineage modules
   - Critical for abstraction layer

### Dependencies

- Python 3.11
- pytest for testing
- Mock storage implementation for tests
- Type hints and validation throughout

## Technical Context

### Technical Assumptions

1. Document IDs are unique across the system
2. Parent documents must exist before child relationships
3. Storage implementation handles serialization
4. Validation occurs before storage operations

### External Services

- No direct external service dependencies
- Storage abstraction allows for different backends

### Performance Considerations

1. Validation strategies optimized for minimal traversal
2. Caching considerations in storage interface
3. Efficient relationship tracking

### Security Requirements

1. Input validation on all operations
2. No circular references allowed
3. Parent-child relationship validation

## Development Progress

### Last Completed Tasks

1. Migrated core document operations
2. Implemented comprehensive test suite
3. Fixed circular reference validation
4. Updated import paths
5. Added integration tests

### Immediate Next Steps

1. Update API documentation for both modules
2. Remove original source files:
   - `document_operations.py`
   - `document_lineage.py`
   - `lineage_manager.py`
   - `lineage_operations.py`
3. Complete cross-package functionality tests

### Known Issues

1. API documentation needs updating
2. Some import paths may need adjustment
3. Cross-package functionality tests pending

### Failed Approaches

1. Initial attempt at relative imports (switched to absolute)
2. Direct protocol instantiation in tests (implemented mock)
3. Simple error messages (enhanced for clarity)

## Developer Notes

### Codebase Insights

1. Absolute imports preferred throughout
2. Strict type checking enforced
3. Comprehensive validation before operations
4. Test fixtures provide reusable setup

### Temporary Solutions

1. Mock storage implementation for testing
2. Some TODOs in documentation
3. Pending API documentation updates

### Areas Needing Attention

1. API documentation completeness
2. Cross-package functionality testing
3. Performance optimization opportunities
4. Security review of validation strategies

### Best Practices

1. Always use absolute imports
2. Maintain comprehensive test coverage
3. Document all public interfaces
4. Validate inputs thoroughly
5. Handle errors gracefully with clear messages
