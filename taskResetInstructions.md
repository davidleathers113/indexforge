# Development Context Summary

## Task Overview & Current Status

### Core Problem/Feature

- Implementing a document processing system with support for multiple file types (Excel, Word)
- Focus on performance, resource management, and scalability
- Part of larger ML pipeline migration and restructuring effort

### Current Status

- Base processor framework completed ✅
- Excel and Word processors implemented ✅
- Integration tests completed ✅
- Performance benchmarks implemented ✅
- Currently in Phase 3 of migration (ML Component Migration)

### Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Processor Hierarchy**

   - Base processor class with common functionality
   - Specialized processors for each document type
   - Rationale: Promotes code reuse and consistent interface

2. **Configuration Management**

   - Pydantic-based configuration system
   - Separate configs for each processor type
   - Rationale: Type safety and validation at configuration level

3. **Resource Management**
   - Context manager pattern for resource cleanup
   - Explicit initialization/cleanup lifecycle
   - Rationale: Predictable resource handling and memory management

### Critical Constraints

- Memory usage limits: < 500MB per processor instance
- Processing time: < 30s for standard documents
- Thread safety for concurrent processing
- Proper resource cleanup required

## Codebase Navigation

### Key Files (By Importance)

1. `src/ml/processing/document/base.py`

   - Core processor interface and base implementation
   - Defines ProcessingResult and resource management
   - Recently added: Error handling improvements

2. `src/ml/processing/document/excel.py`

   - Excel-specific document processor
   - Handles spreadsheet parsing and validation
   - Recent changes: Memory optimization for large files

3. `src/ml/processing/document/word.py`

   - Word document processor implementation
   - Manages text, tables, and metadata extraction
   - Recent changes: Added image handling support

4. `src/ml/processing/document/config.py`

   - Configuration classes for all processors
   - Validation rules and defaults
   - Recent changes: Updated for Pydantic v2 compatibility

5. `tests/integration/ml/processing/document/test_processor_integration.py`

   - Integration tests for processor interactions
   - Concurrent processing validation
   - Recent changes: Added error propagation tests

6. `tests/integration/ml/processing/document/test_processor_performance.py`
   - Performance benchmarks and resource monitoring
   - Memory and CPU utilization tests
   - Recent addition: Comprehensive performance metrics

### Dependencies

- python-docx: Word document processing
- pandas: Excel file handling
- pydantic: Configuration management
- pytest: Testing framework
- psutil: Resource monitoring

## Technical Context

### Technical Assumptions

- Documents are UTF-8 encoded
- Excel files follow standard Office Open XML format
- Word documents contain standard elements (text, tables, images)
- System has sufficient memory for parallel processing

### External Services

- None currently - all processing is local
- Future integration planned with storage services

### Performance Considerations

1. Memory Management

   - Streaming large files when possible
   - Explicit cleanup of resources
   - Memory usage monitoring and limits

2. Scalability
   - Thread-safe processor implementations
   - Configurable batch sizes
   - Resource pooling for concurrent processing

### Security Considerations

- File size limits enforced
- File type validation
- Content validation before processing
- Memory limits to prevent DOS

## Development Progress

### Last Completed Tasks

1. Implemented performance benchmarks

   - Processing time measurements
   - Memory usage tracking
   - Resource utilization monitoring
   - Concurrent load testing

2. Added integration tests
   - Sequential processing
   - Concurrent processing
   - Error propagation
   - Resource cleanup

### Immediate Next Steps

1. Implement batch processing functionality
2. Add service layer integration
3. Complete tracking migration
4. Update documentation with performance guidelines

### Known Issues

1. Linter error in integration tests (unused variable)
2. Import path issues in some modules
3. Memory spikes during large file processing

### Failed Approaches

1. Using memory mapping for large files

   - Issue: Inconsistent performance across platforms
   - Solution: Switched to chunked reading

2. Generic processor configuration
   - Issue: Lost type safety
   - Solution: Specialized configs for each processor type

## Developer Notes

### Codebase Insights

- Processor initialization is lazy - resources allocated on first use
- Configuration validation happens at instantiation time
- Error handling follows hierarchy pattern
- Memory cleanup is automatic via context managers

### Temporary Solutions

- Manual garbage collection calls in large file tests
- Fixed timeouts in performance tests
- Hardcoded limits for concurrent processing

### Areas Needing Attention

1. Resource pooling for concurrent processing
2. Error recovery mechanisms
3. Performance optimization for memory usage
4. Service layer integration points
5. Documentation of performance characteristics

### Best Practices

1. Always use context managers for processors
2. Validate configurations before processing
3. Monitor memory usage in concurrent scenarios
4. Follow error handling patterns
5. Add performance tests for new features
