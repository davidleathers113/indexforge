# IndexForge Migration - Development Context Summary

## Task Overview & Current Status

### Core Problem

- Migrating functionality from connector-specific implementations to core infrastructure
- Primary focus on source tracking and document lineage features
- Goal: Create a more maintainable, centralized architecture

### Current Status

- Core infrastructure completed (storage, metrics, security)
- Source tracking migration in progress
- Model migrations completed (6 models moved to core)
- Documentation and API updates ongoing

### Key Architectural Decisions

1. Separation of Core vs. Connector-Specific Code

   - Moving shared functionality to `src/core/`
   - Keeping connector-specific logic in `src/connectors/`
   - Rationale: Better reusability and maintenance

2. Modular Structure

   - Separate modules for tracking, processing, monitoring
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Rationale: Easier testing and maintenance

3. Enhanced Security Model
   - Centralized encryption management
   - Secure metadata persistence
   - Rationale: Consistent security across all components

### Critical Constraints

- Must maintain backward compatibility
- Performance impact < 2% degradation
- Test coverage must remain > 80%
- Zero downtime migration required

## Codebase Navigation

### Key Files (By Priority)

1. Source Tracking Core

   ```
   src/core/tracking/models/*.py
   - Status: Migrated
   - Role: Core data models for tracking system
   - Changes: Moved from connector-specific implementation
   ```

2. Document Processing

   ```
   src/core/processors/*.py
   - Status: Pending migration
   - Role: Document format handling
   - Planned: Move from connectors to core
   ```

3. Monitoring & Management

   ```
   src/core/monitoring/*.py
   - Status: Pending migration
   - Role: System health and monitoring
   - Planned: Centralize monitoring functionality
   ```

4. Storage & Transformation
   ```
   src/core/storage/*.py
   - Status: Partially migrated
   - Role: Data persistence and transformation
   - Changes: Base implementation complete
   ```

### Dependencies

- Weaviate v4.10.4 (vector database)
- Redis (caching)
- OpenAI API (embeddings)
- RabbitMQ (messaging) - Pending integration

## Technical Context

### Technical Assumptions

1. All document processing is async
2. Storage is eventually consistent
3. Metadata updates are atomic
4. Vector operations are idempotent

### External Services Integration

- Vector Database (Weaviate)

  - Used for: Semantic search
  - Status: Operational

- Redis Cache

  - Used for: Performance optimization
  - Status: Implementation complete

- OpenAI API
  - Used for: Document embeddings
  - Status: Operational

### Performance Considerations

- Batch processing for large operations
- Memory management with usage tracking
- Metrics sampling for high-volume operations
- Cache optimization with TTL and LRU

### Security Requirements

- Encryption at rest
- Secure metadata storage
- Key rotation support
- Tenant isolation

## Development Progress

### Last Completed Milestone

- Migration of core tracking models
  - 6 models moved to core infrastructure
  - Test coverage maintained at 85%
  - Performance impact < 2%

### Immediate Next Steps

1. Move remaining source tracking files
2. Implement document lineage features
3. Complete API documentation
4. Finalize security features

### Known Issues

1. Import statements need updating throughout codebase
2. Some circular dependencies in tracking system
3. Documentation inconsistencies
4. Pending security review for new components

### Failed Approaches

1. Attempted direct file migration without dependency analysis

   - Issue: Broke circular references
   - Solution: Implemented staged migration

2. Initial monolithic tracking system
   - Issue: Poor maintainability
   - Solution: Split into modular components

## Developer Notes

### Codebase Insights

1. Heavy use of Protocol classes for interfaces
2. Extensive use of async/await patterns
3. Complex dependency graph in tracking system
4. Careful handling of tenant isolation required

### Temporary Solutions

1. Some hardcoded configurations (to be moved to config files)
2. Manual cache invalidation (Redis integration pending)
3. Basic error handling (to be enhanced)

### Areas Needing Attention

1. Document lineage circular references
2. Performance impact of encryption
3. Cache invalidation strategy
4. Cross-tenant data isolation
5. API versioning strategy

### Migration Validation

- Run full test suite after each component move
- Verify functionality in development environment
- Check for import errors
- Validate documentation accuracy
- Performance testing after migration
