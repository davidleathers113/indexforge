# Weaviate Service Test Plan

## Unit Tests (`tests/unit/services/test_weaviate_service.py`)

### 1. Service Lifecycle Tests

- [ ] Test initialization with valid settings
- [ ] Test initialization with invalid settings
- [ ] Test cleanup procedure
- [ ] Test health check functionality
- [ ] Test service state transitions
- [ ] Test connection error handling
- [ ] Test retry mechanism during initialization

### 2. Object Operation Tests

- [ ] Test adding single object
- [ ] Test adding batch objects
- [ ] Test retrieving object by ID
- [ ] Test deleting object
- [ ] Test object validation
- [ ] Test error handling for invalid objects
- [ ] Test retry mechanism for failed operations

### 3. Error Handling Tests

- [ ] Test connection timeout scenarios
- [ ] Test authentication failures
- [ ] Test invalid API key handling
- [ ] Test network interruption recovery
- [ ] Test rate limiting handling
- [ ] Test batch operation partial failures
- [ ] Test service state validation

### 4. Configuration Tests

- [ ] Test URL validation
- [ ] Test API key configuration
- [ ] Test timeout settings
- [ ] Test retry policy configuration
- [ ] Test batch size limits
- [ ] Test connection pooling

## Integration Tests (`tests/integration/services/test_weaviate_integration.py`)

### 1. End-to-End Tests

- [ ] Test complete object lifecycle
- [ ] Test batch processing with real data
- [ ] Test error recovery in live environment
- [ ] Test connection pool management
- [ ] Test concurrent operations

### 2. Performance Tests

- [ ] Test batch operation throughput
- [ ] Test connection pool efficiency
- [ ] Test retry impact on performance
- [ ] Test memory usage patterns
- [ ] Test CPU utilization

### 3. Edge Cases

- [ ] Test with large objects
- [ ] Test with high concurrency
- [ ] Test with network latency
- [ ] Test with service restarts
- [ ] Test with invalid schema

## Monitoring Tests (`tests/unit/monitoring/test_weaviate_monitoring.py`)

### 1. Metrics Tests

- [ ] Test operation counters
- [ ] Test error rate tracking
- [ ] Test latency measurements
- [ ] Test batch size metrics
- [ ] Test connection pool metrics

### 2. Health Check Tests

- [ ] Test service health reporting
- [ ] Test degraded state detection
- [ ] Test recovery monitoring
- [ ] Test resource usage tracking

## Notes

- All tests should use the new mock infrastructure
- Integration tests should be configurable for CI/CD
- Performance tests should have clear baseline metrics
- Error scenarios should be reproducible
- Test data should be properly isolated

## Dependencies

- [ ] Create mock Weaviate client
- [ ] Set up test fixtures
- [ ] Define test data generators
- [ ] Create helper assertions
- [ ] Set up monitoring infrastructure
